    <description>The first iteration of this mod, Medieval faction, is a missing link between tribals and outlanders. With this mod you can experience the proper medieval siege, as the enemy base generation builds a massive, towering fortress with buildings inside. Have your own vineyard and brew the best wine, which gains in value the longer itâ€™s in the barrel! Medieval subjects will be equipped with new armor, color-coded depending on the faction color, making medieval armies look like an actual army serving the same lord. Receive caravans of medieval armor makers, weaponsmiths, mercenaries and the elusive art patron!</description>
